# cashflow_sheet_helper

## Introduction
This app is aimed at being a helper for the fantastic [Cashflow](https://www.richdad.com/products/cashflow-the-board-game) board game by Robert Kiyosaki.

## Motivation
The Cashflow game is an effective and fun way to learn the basics of how to handle money, and I absolutely love playing it. The game has one problem, though: To do much of what progresses you through the game, you have to do some manual writing and calculations. An example for this would be taking up a loan to buy a house or a business -- that's two steps and each requires you to do some calculations and update some things on your game card.

Besides being a bit cumbersome especially during later stages of the game, the manual calculations and writing slows down the game's pace quite significantly. Therefore, I decided to implement a little helper that acts as a kind of digital game card.

Using this app, my friends and I were able to play two full rounds of Cashflow in a single afternoon -- compared to the entire day a single round took us with all the manual calculation and writing.

## What This App Is
A helper app that incorporates all the game's rules and provides convenient buttons to mirror the in-game actions. Its goal is to enable players to focus more on the fun parts of the Cashflow game by taking away all the manual calculations and writing. 

Note, however, that the app isn't finished yet -- as you'll notice, there is still quite a list of todos (located in the `main.dart` file in case you want to have a look). So, in its current state, the app is more of a prototype.

## What This App Is Not
At the risk of stating the obvious: This app is not a replacement for the board game -- it merely incorporates the game's rules and automates common tasks players have to perform to progress through the game, but does not contain a digital representation of the board or some figurines to move around.
